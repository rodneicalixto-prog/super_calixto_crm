## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-30

First open-source self-hosted release. Migration from the SaaS multi-tenant
codebase to a single-organization deployable image.

### Changed

- Migrated SaaS multi-tenant build to Open Source Self-Hosted (single
  organization per instance).
- BYOK removed — Meta and LLM credentials now come from Edge Function
  environment variables (`META_*`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `LLM_PROVIDER`,
  `LLM_API_KEY`) instead of the encrypted `tenant_credentials` table.
- White-label (dynamic logo / favicon / brand colors) removed. The fixed
  Agentise dark glassmorphism theme is the only theme.
- Onboarding wizard collapsed into `SettingsPage` sections (AI agent, business
  hours, team, account, Supabase).
- Roles consolidated to `admin` / `operator`. The first signed-up user is
  promoted to `admin`; subsequent users land as `operator`.

### Removed

- `tenants`, `tenant_settings`, `tenant_credentials` tables.
- `tenant_id` from every domain table and from every frontend query / type.
- `super_admin` role and the `/admin` super-admin panel.
- `OnboardingPage` and the six onboarding steps.
- `save-tenant-credentials` Edge Function.
- `whatsapp-hub-logos` storage bucket and its multi-tenant policies.
- `app.whatsapp_hub_encryption_key` Vault entry (and `pgcrypto` symmetric
  helpers used only by `tenant_credentials`).

### Renamed

- `tenant_members` → `app_users`.

### Kept intentionally

- `/setup` route — the operator pastes Supabase URL + anon key into the
  browser on first visit; nothing about the build needs to change per
  deployment.
- Supabase schema namespace `whatsapp_hub` — the Supabase project may be
  shared with other Agentise apps.
- Meta tier caps (`tier_250` / `tier_1k` / `tier_10k` / `tier_100k`) — these
  are official Meta limits, not commercial plans, and gate the dispatcher
  batch size.
- `push-migrations.mjs` and `deploy-functions.mjs` scripts. They use the
  Supabase Management API (no DB password required) and remain the
  recommended ops path.
